# Pollution-monitoring-system-network-simulation
<h3>A network simulation for Pollution monitoring system using <b><i>Cisco Packet Tracer</i></b>.</h3>

--> This project proposes an air pollution monitoring system and has been implemented with a set of sensors available in cisco packet tracer that are useful for measuring the air contaminents like CO<sub>2</sub> , NO<sub>2</sub> , SO<sub>2</sub> , etc.
<br />--> The pollution monitoring system was designed to monitor and analyze air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) has been used to access the HTTP server using registration server.

This system also proposes an alarm system which will notify the concerned authorities depending upon the level of smoke and carbon dioxide in the air present. The other IOT part of the system deals with the automation of the houses or facilities where the system is installed. This automated system will automatically open the doors and windows of the facility/house if the smoke
arises upon a certain threshold without the need of any human intervention.
<br/><br/>
This network simulation would be implemented individually for different locations where the data or readings accumulated by the sensors will be sent and processed on the cloud and further sent to the end applications and server. We have used the IOT simulation tool Cisco packet tracer for simulation. It shows the forwarding process of packets virtually so that this can be implemented further for the real-time applications.

This system aims to bring the air pollution under control by monitoring the air pollution 24 / 7 and storing data and taking necessary steps as per requirement.
